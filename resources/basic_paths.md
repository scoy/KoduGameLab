* [Slides for module 6](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Kodu/Curriculum/modules/06/slides6.pdf) and [PowerPoint source](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Kodu/Curriculum/modules/06/slides6.pptx)
* Student Ages: 9-14 years old
* Activity Time: 45-60 minutes
* Activity Level: Beginner Coder

### Prerequisites
* Download and Installation of Kodu

### Student Activities
[HexGraph1 Exercise: Following a series of paths using a state machine](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Kodu/Curriculum/modules/06/06-hexgraph1.pdf)<br> 
Explore the Kodu World: "HexGraph1". Student will be playing cooperatively to observe  the character following a series of paths to reach the desired object: castle. Experiment with paths required to cross before safely reaching the desired object. Demonstrate the learning by building a solution using the sequence of path colors required to reach the desired object.  Develop a state machine with pseudo code. Then write the state machine using the concept of paths in the world. Test the sate machine solution by writing code and running the program. Complete a journal activity to document and record any experiments undertaken by the group.<br>

[Ants1 Exercise: Ant trap](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Kodu/Curriculum/modules/06/06-ants1.pdf). It combines pursuit, path following, and state machines. 
Explore the Kodu World: "Ants1". Student will be playing  to move from the village to the dessert with the desired characters: ants. Experiment with code required to have the desired character from the village to the dessert. Demonstrate the learning by building a solution following the state machines required to move between the village and dessert. Follow the three state machine logic to move between the dessert and village. Follow the state machine logic by moving  ants from the village to the dessert. Complete a journal activity to document and record any experiments undertaken by the group.<br>
