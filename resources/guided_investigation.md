### Student Activities
[**Warm up review of Flashy Fishybots**](2_Lesson_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=2)<br>
Introduce Guided Investigation by presenting the Big Questions with [slide 2](2_Slides_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=2):  Questions we'll answer. Explore and run the Kodu World: "[Flashy Fishbots](http://worlds.kodugamelab.com/world/sQSa7QMWL06j_Z0r8xuKOA==)" Kodu Game Lab main menu.<br>
*Subjects: Computer Science, Design Technology, Digital Literacy, 21st Century Learning Skills*

[**The When…Do…Programming Construct**](2_Lesson_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=2)<br>
Students will learn to program the characters' action as instructed on [slide 3](2_Slides_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=3): When…Do… Programming Construct Question. Students will make a character bigger when bumped anything in the world. Students will write code with fill-in-the-blank sentences starting on [slide 4](https://kodu.blob.core.windows.net/kodu/Resources/2_Slides_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=4): When…Do… Programming Construct Question 1<br>
*Subjects: Computer Science, Design Technology, Digital Literacy, 21st Century Learning Skills*

[**Unplugged Activity: When…Do…Can Do**](2_Lesson_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=3)<br>
Students will complete an unplugged activity using the basic program concept for When…Do… actions. These concepts are reviewed on [slide 7](2_Slides_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=7): When...Do...Can...Do<br>
*Subjects: Computer Science, Design Technology, Digital Literacy, 21st Century Learning Skills*

[**Fishbots Tutorial**](2_Lesson_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=4)<br>
Students describe the difference between Kodu tutorials and finished games by following the definitions on [slide 9](2_Slides_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=9): Fishbots Tutorial. Students will collaborate for pair programming. One student is the Map Reader and the other student as the Driver. Students will collaboratively design, plan, and create a Kodu game.<br>

### Performance Expectations
[**Flashy Fish Revisions**]()<br> 
Students will learn to program the characters' action as instructed on [slide 10](2_Slides_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=10): Revise Flashy Fishbots action. Students will receive support to program the characters in the Student Guide Activity: [Add A New Line](Student_Guide_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=7). Students will learn how to save work by showing on [slide 11](2_Slides_Kodu_Makerspace.pdf#page=11): Saving Changes
