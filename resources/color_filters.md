* [Slides for module 2](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Kodu/Curriculum/modules/02/slides2.pdf) and [PowerPoint source](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Kodu/Curriculum/modules/02/slides2.pptx)
* Student Ages: 09-14 years old
* Activity Time: 45-60 minutes
* Activity Level: Beginner Coder

### Prerequisites
* Download and Installation of Kodu
* [Lesson 1: Eating apples](eating_apples)

### Learning Objectives 
* Learn the “Pursue and Consume” idiom.
* Learn to use a color filter with common actions such as "see" and "bumped".
* Learn that the “grab” action picks up an object.
* Learn that the “color it” action changes the color of an object.
* Learn to use “once” for button-triggered actions.

### Student Activities
[Apple2 Tips: Eat red apples; grab blue ones](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Kodu/Curriculum/modules/02/02-apple2-tips.pdf)<br>
Explore and run the following Kodu World: "Apple2". Apply Critical Thinking skills to control the character to eat red apples and grab blue apples. Utilize common action to consume red apples and grab blue apples. Use Computer Science skills to program character movement and actions. Use Science process skills in observing, experimenting, and representing data with objects and actions. Students will discuss the objects behavior and its actions.<br>

Activity Note: Replace Gamepad with [Touch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrC6DpueYpQ&t=14s) or [Keyboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAaSuV09CXU). 

[Apple2X tips: Work cooperatively to competing for randomly-generated red and blue apples](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Kodu/Curriculum/modules/02/02-apple2x-tips.pdf)<br>
Explore and run the following Kodu World: "Apple2X". Collaborate and compete to capture randomly-generated red and blue objects, apples. Use Computer Science skills to program character movement and action with multiple characters. Use Science process skills in observing, experimenting, and representing data with objects and actions. Students will discuss the objects behavior and its actions.<br>
