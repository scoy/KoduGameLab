### Learning Objectives
* Students will sample a population to collect performance data on the task when given a task.
* Students will use measures of center such as the mean and median, to describe the data set when given a set of data.

### Student Activities
<a name="activator"></a>
[**Activator**](6_Kodu_Curriculum_Math_Module.pdf#page=54)<br>
Students will review how to calculate the average of number sets. Students will be collecting data on how quickly people complete their obstacle courses when the number of apples to pick up increases.
*Subjects: Math, Computer Science, Digital Technology, Engineering, 21st Century Learning*

<a name="collection"></a>
[**Data Collection and Calculation**](6_Kodu_Curriculum_Math_Module.pdf#page=56)<br>
Students will recruit at least 4 students from outside their group to play their game. The students will play two versions of the game. One version will have x items to pick up, while the other version will have 2x items. Students will use 5 and 10 items. Students hypothesize how long it will take other students to collect 5 items and then 10 items. Students will calculate the difference between the two hypothesized times. Students will discuss if it will take double the time to collect double the items. Students will perform calculations on the data and create a table.

<a name="analysis"></a>
[**Data Analysis**](6_Kodu_Curriculum_Math_Module.pdf#page=57)<br>
Students will answer questions in their student activity sheet to report the results of their data collection. It is up to the teacher’s discretion whether to assign the data analysis as group or individual work.

### Performance Expectations
<a name="report"></a>
[**Collect data, analyze it, and report your findings**](6_Kodu_Curriculum_Math_Module.pdf#page=54). Students will pick four other students to play two different versions of your game. In one version there will be x items to pick up, and the other version will have 2x items. Complete the headings in the tables below by filling in the number of items you have in each version. Hypothesize the average time it will take your peers to complete each version of your game. Collect the data and calculate the averages. Analyze the data to see if it turned out the way you expected it.
