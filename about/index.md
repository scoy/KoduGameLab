## What is Kodu?
Kodu lets kids create games on Windows PCs via a simple visual programming language. Kodu can be used to teach creativity, problem solving, storytelling, as well as programming. Anyone can use Kodu to make a game, young children as well as adults with no design or programming skills.

Since Kodu's introduction in 2009, we have visited the White House, teamed up with great groups like NCWIT and DigiGirlz, inspired academic research and been the subject of a book (Kodu for Kids).

Kodu for the PC is available to [download](https://scoy.github.io/KoduGameLab/downloads/) for free.
